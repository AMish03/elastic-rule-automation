# This is a CODEOWNERS file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.

# Set 'abc_22' as the mandatory code owner for the 'main' branch.
# The pattern should match the branch name (or files/directories).
# In this case, '*' matches all files and directories in the repository.
# The owner is specified after the pattern.
